Prior to beginning the analysis, a variety of checks were conducted for data quality and validation and familiarisation of the datasets. The SQL queries
utilised to inspect and perform quality check can be found [here](https://github.com/OtKwesi/SalesAnalytics_BritainShoppers/blob/748acc61a4378564ef3fe4583bc10460aa08c288/SQL_Data_Inspection_and_Validation_Checks.pdf)

# Executive Summary  
Overview of Findings  
In FY 2024, British Shoppers Retail Outlet earned £159,771 in revenue, with Q3 accounting for almost one-third of yearly sales, making it a strategic significance
contributor. September recorded the highest revenue for the month (£25,249), whereas February and November underperformed significantly. Sales from new, regular, 
and VIP customers were almost evenly divided, though all three segments witnessed high cancellation rates of 28% that created retention threats. Geographically, 
London had preponderant sales (£51.4k) and also had high fulfilment issues. Manchester was well behind with only £20.7k of contribution. Overall order fulfillment 
at 47% fell short of industry norms, 25% cancellations, and 28% pending orders indicate systemic operational inefficiencies. While there was a healthy profit 
margin (37.6%), key changes are necessary in logistics, customer experience, and geographic strategy to unlock more than £500k of revenue opportunity.
